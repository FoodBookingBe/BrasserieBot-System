# Restaurant Payment Processing Systems

Payment processing is a critical component of restaurant operations, directly impacting customer experience, operational efficiency, and financial management. This document provides comprehensive information about payment systems in the restaurant industry.

## Payment Processing Fundamentals

### 1. Payment Flow Overview

**Authorization Process**
- Customer presents payment method
- Terminal/POS requests authorization from payment processor
- Processor routes request to card network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- Card network forwards to issuing bank
- Issuing bank approves/declines based on available funds
- Response follows reverse path back to terminal
- Typical authorization time: 2-10 seconds

**Settlement Process**
- Merchant batches authorized transactions (typically daily)
- Batch sent to payment processor
- Processor routes transactions to respective card networks
- Card networks forward to issuing banks
- Issuing banks transfer funds to acquiring bank
- Acquiring bank deposits funds to merchant account
- Typical settlement time: 24-72 hours

**Reconciliation Process**
- Matching POS sales data with processor reports
- Identifying discrepancies (voids, refunds, chargebacks)
- Accounting for processing fees
- Verifying deposit amounts
- Resolving exceptions

### 2. Fee Structure

**Interchange Fees**
- Set by card networks (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- Paid to card-issuing banks
- Varies based on:
  - Card type (credit vs. debit)
  - Card category (rewards, business, etc.)
  - Processing method (chip, contactless, manual entry)
  - Business category (MCC code)

**Processor Markup**
- Additional fees charged by payment processor
- Pricing models include:
  - Interchange-plus: Interchange + fixed markup
  - Flat rate: Single percentage regardless of card type
  - Tiered: Qualified, mid-qualified, non-qualified rates
  - Subscription: Monthly fee + per-transaction fee

**Additional Fees**
- Monthly service fees
- PCI compliance fees
- Gateway fees
- Chargeback fees
- Batch processing fees
- Early termination fees

### 3. Security Standards

**PCI DSS Compliance**
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- 12 requirements covering:
  - Network security
  - Cardholder data protection
  - Vulnerability management
  - Access control
  - Network monitoring
  - Security policy maintenance
- Compliance levels based on transaction volume
- Annual validation requirements

**EMV Technology**
- Chip card standard (Europay, Mastercard, Visa)
- Creates unique transaction code for each payment
- Significantly reduces counterfeit fraud
- Liability shift: Non-EMV compliant merchants liable for fraud

**Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)**
- Encrypts card data from point of entry to processor
- Reduces PCI compliance scope
- Prevents data interception during transmission
- Hardware and software implementation options

**Tokenization**
- Replaces card data with unique identifier (token)
- Original card data stored securely by processor
- Enables secure storage for recurring payments
- Reduces risk of data breaches
