Based on your analysis of the codebase, please create a detailed implementation plan that includes:

1. A high-level overview of the feature and its components

- Use Prisma for database operations
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Consider performance, security, and scalability

Provide complete, production-ready code that can be directly integrated into the codebase.
